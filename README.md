stack
=====

our stack project

1) sorts stack by numerical value <5 at bottom of stack, >5 at top of stack
2) reverse stack (reverses the order of the values in the stack -- bottom values go to the top)
3) pop all (takes all values out of the initial stack array, puts them in new array, returns that new array) 
4) ascending (sorts stack in ascending order) 
5) descending (reverses the ascending order stack and returns new array)
6) pop all from certain point (chooses a random point, creates an array the size of top-that point, puts values from that point onwards into new array)
7) peak all (creates array the same size as stack, puts all values of stack in that new array, returns new array)
8) peak at position (chooses random point, returns stack at that point)
